A small project that I made in high school following this tutorial:

It is a website that allows you to play against a simple CPU opponent where you can also set their calculating time and thus affecting the difficulty of the match. The main purpose of this project is to have a preview, as a high school student, of how coding can be implemented in completing an object. I also made a file introducing the process of me following the tutorial and making the website, and the things that I learned in each stage. It is one of my first coding experiences and is of the largest scale at the time.
